  <head> Uncovering a Quantum Phase Transition in Nuclei </head>

    <p>
      The authors point out that, for a given value of a, a nucleus predicted to be on one side of the quantum<br>
       phase transition in their leading-order calculation might be predicted to be on the other side with a higher-order calculation. This potential sensitivity to the precise nucleon-nucleon interaction<br>
       is what leads the authors to suggest that “nature is near a quantum phase transition”
